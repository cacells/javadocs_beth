thingInfo// Classes are a collection of things that have name, type and description. For instance a variable (field) has a name, type, and may be described. A method has a name, a return type, and may also be described. So, thingInfo is a Class to store a collection of three strings called name, type, and description.
%fields
String/name/Name of the thing
String/type/A type associated with the thing. e.g. if the thing is a field then type might be boolean. If the thing is a method, then the type would be the return type of the method, e.g. void. Type is not used for class things or constructor things.
String/descript/A description of the thing.
%constructors
 thingInfo()//default constructor sets empty strings
 thingInfo(String allinfo)//constructor to set the fields from a single input string which holds name, type, and description separated by forward slashes. The order of the info must be correct.
 thingInfo(String allinfo,boolean swapit)//constructor to set the fields from a single input string. The boolean swapit determines whether the fields are in standard format (name before type) or in swapped format (type before name).
 thingInfo(String thename,String thetype,String thedescript) //unused constructor
 thingInfo(thingInfo orig)//copy constructor
%methods
 void/ cloneVals(thingInfo orig)/copy field values from orig 
 void /setValsFromString(String allinfo)/set the field values from a forward slash delimited string
 void/setName(String thename)/set the name field
 void/ setType(String thetype)/set the type field
 void/ setDescript(String thedescript)/set the description field
 String/ toString()/Returns a string for printing
ArrayList<String>/ breakItUp(String msg)/break a string into fields at each slash separator.
