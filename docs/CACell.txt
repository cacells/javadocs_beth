%class 
CACell//this class describes the cell and its state, and has methods to update the cell's state
%field
int/maxCycle/ this sets the CAmax to 4 (see type)
Random/ rand/random variable
boolean/ canMoveLeft/keep track of the state of the cell
boolean/ canMoveRight/ditto
boolean/canStay/ditto
boolean/Available/keep track of the state of the cell
int/ type/type of cell: 0 = space, 1 = SC, 2=CA_1....5=CA_4
CABoxStatic/ home/ The box the cell sits in
double/ stain/could be used to indicate age 
double/ scRate/ Relative SC proliferaion rate if scRate = 0.5 SC proliferaion rate would be half CA rate
int/ lineage/unique number for each cell in the initial set
%constructors
CACell(CABoxStatic home,int lin)//gives the cell a home, a lineage, a stain of zero, and makes the home unavailable
%methods
 void/ maintain(ParamVals params)/ Determines if a Cell can detach or grow and sets counters
void/ growth(CACell cHold)/ Growth occurs into cell
boolean/ grow()/ given movement left or right checks for space and moves
