%class 
CAGridStatic//This is the main part of the simulation of the CA version of the model
%fields
ArrayList <CACell> /tissue/ List of cells that make up the tissue
ParamVals/params/parameters of the experiment 
Random/rand/random class
%constructors	
CAGridStatic(int size)// Create new instance of simulation with size of grid maximum CA cycle and fraction of stem cells 
%methods
int/bounds(int a,int size)/ Creates the toroidal links between top and bottom and left and right	
void/ stain()/ Stains all cells in the tissue list
void/ setNewGridParams/ set grid params such as probability of moving right
void/ iterate/ The main iterative loop of the simulation. Update tissue status then move randomly through.
